# Will's jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

The jQuery Salary Calculator showcases the relationship between jQuery, JavaScript, and HTML in order to generate an employee database which calculates the average monthly cost of a list of employees. This code instantaneously translates employee information transcribed in input fields via a submit button at the top of the DOM in order to progressively calculate the monthly cost of employees on payroll. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the cell will highlight red, indicating that company losses are imminent. The process was streamlined via a function, called addToTable, which takes in an employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary and populates one row of the table. The annual salary input is then divided by twelve in order to calculate monthly cost. As more employees are added to the table, their monthly costs are summed together to calculate the total monthly cost of the list. A deletion function, called removeTable, also exists which works with the 'DELETE' button to remove the selected row from the table, although calculations do not currently react to the feature.
